                <h2><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-he-is-committed-us-ownership-gaza-2025-02-09/">US committed to ‘buying and owning’ Gaza, Trump says</a></h2>
                <p>US President Donald Trump has said the two million Palestinians who would be resettled in neighbouring countries under his plan to take over and rebuild the Gaza Strip would have no right of return.

                    "No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing," he told Fox News. "I'm talking about building a permanent place for them."
                    
                    A clip of the interview was released a day after Trump said he was "committed to buying and owning Gaza", despite global condemnation of the plan he unveiled last week.
                    
                    The Palestinian Authority and the armed group Hamas, whose 16-month war with Israel has caused widespread devastation in Gaza, reiterated that Palestinian land was "not for sale".
                    
                    But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's proposal as "revolutionary and creative".
                    
                    The UN has warned that any forced displacement of civilians from occupied territory is strictly prohibited under international law and "tantamount to ethnic cleansing".
                    
                    It comes three weeks into a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, during which Hamas has released some of the Israeli hostages it is holding in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
                    
                    The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
                    
                    More than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
                    
                    Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.
                    Israel's prime minister praised Trump's proposal at a cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday.
                    <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/92fd/live/8f11e400-e7a1-11ef-8593-65a781785cd6.jpg.webp" alt="Trump News">

"For a full year, we have been told that on the 'day after', the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organisation], the Palestinian Authority, needs to be in the Strip," Netanyahu said.

"President Trump came with a completely different vision, much better for the State of Israel, a revolutionary and creative vision, which we are discussing. He is very determined to carry it out. This also opens many possibilities before us."

The Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry said: "The rights of our people and our land are not for sale, exchange or bargaining."

"The Israeli government and Prime Minister Netanyahu are trying to cover up the crimes of genocide, forced displacement and annexation which they have committed against our people," it added.

"For this purpose, they continue to promote slogans and positions which are separate from the political reality and far from the requirements of the political solutions to the conflict."

A political official from Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries - said Trump's remarks were "absurd" and reflected "deep ignorance of Palestine and the region".

"Gaza is not a property to be sold and bought. It is an integral part of our occupied Palestinian land," Izzat al-Rishq stated.

Palestinians fear a repeat of the Nakba, or "catastrophe", when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.

Many of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the West Bank, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war along with Gaza, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN.

Palestinians insist on the right of those refugees to return but Israel has refused this.

Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods. The UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has.</p>

                    <p>Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights group, says that Israeli forces have demolished 10 homes in the village of Masafer Yatta, forcibly displacing about eight families.

                        In a post on X, Al-Haq said the soldiers also destroyed two agricultural buildings and uprooted trees in the village, which is located south of the city of Hebron. The rights group noted that the Israeli military and settlers have escalated attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank since the ceasefire in Gaza.
                        
                        We reported earlier that Israeli authorities have demolished five houses in Khallet Athaba, another village south of Hebron, displacing about 40 people, mostly children and women.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/police-break-up-pro-palestinian-student-protest-in-berlin-as-demonstrations-spread-across-europe/7601207.html">German police break up pro-Palestinian protest in Berlin</a></h3>
                    <p>Amsterdam — 
                        German police on Tuesday broke up a protest by several hundred pro-Palestinian activists who had occupied a courtyard at Berlin's Free University earlier in the day, the latest such action by authorities as protests that have roiled campuses in the United States spread across Europe.
                        
                        The protesters had put up about 20 tents and formed a human chain around the tents. Most had covered their faces with medical masks and had draped kufiyah scarves around their heads, shouting slogans such as "Viva, viva Palestina."
                        
                        Earlier on Tuesday, Dutch police arrested about 125 activists as they broke up a similar pro-Palestinian demonstration camp at the University of Amsterdam.
                        
                        In Berlin, police called on the students via loudspeakers to leave the campus. Police could also be seen carrying some students away and some scuffles erupted between police officers and protesters.
                        
                        Police used pepper spray against some of the protesters. The school's administrators said in a statement that the protesters had rejected any kind of dialogue and they had therefore called in police to clear the campus.
                        
                        "This form of protest is not geared towards dialogue. An occupation is not acceptable on the FU Berlin campus," university president Guenter Ziegler said. FU is the abbreviation for Free University. "We are available for academic dialog — but not in this way."
                        
                        The administrators said some protesters attempted to enter rooms and lecture halls at Free University in order to occupy them. The protest organizers, which say they are made up of students from various Berlin universities and other individuals, had called on other students and professors to take part in the action, the university statement said.
                        
                        In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France and Britain, following earlier protests at U.S. campuses.
                        
                        Amsterdam police said on the social media platform X that their action was "necessary to restore order" after protests turned violent. There were no immediate reports of injuries.</p>
